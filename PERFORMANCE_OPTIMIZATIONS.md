# Performance Optimizations - v1.1.1

## üöÄ Problem Identified

**User Report:** Extension was making ChatGPT very slow, especially during response generation. Responses would lag and even get stuck mid-phrase.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The extension was firing the `MutationObserver` on **EVERY SINGLE DOM CHANGE**. When ChatGPT generates a response, it updates the DOM character by character (sometimes word by word). This meant our observer was:

- Checking for new message pairs hundreds of times per second
- Calling `applyPruning()` every 500ms during generation
- Running `getAllMessages()` and `getMessagePairs()` repeatedly
- Re-querying the entire DOM constantly

**Result:** Massive performance impact during the exact moment when ChatGPT needs maximum resources.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. MutationObserver Throttling

**Before:**
```javascript
observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
  setTimeout(applyPruning, 500); // Called on EVERY DOM change!
});
observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
```

**After:**
```javascript
observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
  if (observerPaused) return; // Skip during generation
  if (pruningTimeout) return; // Skip if already pending
  
  pruningTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // Check for changes
    pruningTimeout = null;
  }, 2000); // Only check every 2 seconds, not 500ms
});

// Only observe main container, not entire body
const mainContainer = document.querySelector('main') || document.body;
observer.observe(mainContainer, { childList: true, subtree: true });
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ 4x reduction in check frequency (2000ms vs 500ms)
- ‚úÖ Observer pauses entirely during response generation
- ‚úÖ Smaller observation scope (main container vs entire body)

---

### 2. Generation Detection & Observer Pausing

**New Feature:** Automatically detects when ChatGPT is generating a response and **pauses all observation**.

```javascript
function setupGenerationDetection() {
  const checkIfGenerating = () => {
    const stopButton = document.querySelector('button[data-testid="stop-button"]');
    isGenerating = !!stopButton;
    
    if (isGenerating && !wasGenerating) {
      // ChatGPT started generating - PAUSE everything
      window.chatgptSpeedupPauseObserver();
    } else if (!isGenerating && wasGenerating) {
      // Finished - resume and check for changes
      window.chatgptSpeedupResumeObserver();
    }
  };
  
  setInterval(checkIfGenerating, 500);
}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **ZERO** DOM monitoring during response generation
- ‚úÖ Checks resume after generation completes
- ‚úÖ Massive CPU/resource savings during critical time

---

### 3. Scroll Detection Optimization

**Before:**
- Multiple scroll listeners on window, main, and all scrollable containers
- Checked on every scroll event
- Debounce: 150ms

**After:**
- Single scroll listener (main container OR window as fallback)
- Early exit if no hidden messages
- Increased debounce to 200ms
- Reduced IntersectionObserver threshold checks

```javascript
const handleScroll = (event) => {
  if (hiddenMessages.size === 0) return; // Don't process if nothing to expand
  
  clearTimeout(scrollTimeout);
  scrollTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // Process scroll...
  }, 200); // Increased from 150ms
};
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ ~33% reduction in scroll event processing
- ‚úÖ No processing when not needed (no hidden messages)
- ‚úÖ Single listener instead of 3-5

---

### 4. IntersectionObserver Optimization

**Before:**
- Always active, checking 3 thresholds [0, 0.5, 1]
- Set up at multiple times (1s, 3s delays)

**After:**
- Only activates if there are hidden messages
- Single threshold [0.5] instead of 3
- Disconnects when not needed
- Delayed setup (2s) to avoid initialization overhead

```javascript
const setupTopMessageObserver = () => {
  if (hiddenMessages.size === 0) {
    if (topObserver) {
      topObserver.disconnect(); // Clean up if not needed
    }
    return;
  }
  // ... only set up if actually needed
};
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ 66% reduction in threshold checks (1 vs 3)
- ‚úÖ Deactivates when not needed
- ‚úÖ Less initialization overhead

---

### 5. Search Scroll Enhancement

**Problem:** Clicking ‚óÄ/‚ñ∂ arrows didn't scroll to match.

**Solution:** Multi-pronged approach:

1. **Ensure parent visibility:**
   ```javascript
   const messageContainer = currentMark.closest('[data-testid^="conversation-turn-"]');
   if (messageContainer && hiddenMessages.has(messageContainer)) {
     messageContainer.style.display = ''; // Show it!
   }
   ```

2. **Double scroll attempt:**
   ```javascript
   // First: Instant scroll
   currentMark.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'auto', block: 'center' });
   
   // Second: Smooth scroll after 50ms
   setTimeout(() => {
     currentMark.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
   }, 50);
   ```

3. **Visual flash:**
   ```javascript
   // Flash bright orange with shadow for 300ms
   currentMark.style.cssText = 'background-color: #ff6600; color: white; 
                                box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255,102,0,0.5);';
   setTimeout(() => {
     currentMark.style.cssText = 'background-color: orange; ...'; // Back to normal
   }, 300);
   ```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed scroll to match
- ‚úÖ Visual confirmation with flash effect
- ‚úÖ Works even if parent message was hidden

| Observer check frequency | Every 500ms |
| Observation scope | Entire document.body |
| Scroll listeners | 3-5 listeners |

## üêõ Debug Mode

To verify optimizations are working:

1. Enable debug logs in popup
2. Open DevTools console (F12)
3. Start a ChatGPT conversation

**You should see:**
```
[ChatGPT Speedup] Generation detection enabled
[ChatGPT Speedup] ChatGPT started generating - pausing observer
... (no observer messages during generation)
[ChatGPT Speedup] ChatGPT finished generating - resuming observer
[ChatGPT Speedup] Navigating to match 2 of 5  (when using search)
[ChatGPT Speedup] Scrolling to match at position 2/5
```

**You should NOT see during generation:**
```
‚ùå [ChatGPT Speedup] Pruning: ...  (should be paused)
‚ùå [ChatGPT Speedup] Setting keepN to ...  (should be paused)
```

2. **Test with extension disabled** - verify ChatGPT is normal speed
3. **Test with extension enabled** - should be same speed now
4. **Report specific symptoms:**
   - When does it lag? (during generation? always?)
   - What do console logs show?
   - What keepN value are you using?
