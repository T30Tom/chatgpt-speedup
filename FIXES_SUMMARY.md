# Fixes Summary - October 1, 2025

## ‚úÖ All Three Issues Fixed

### 1. Message Counting Changed to Pairs ‚úì

**Problem:** Extension was counting individual turns (user message + ChatGPT response = 2 messages)

**Fixed:** Now treats one user prompt + one ChatGPT response = 1 message

**Changes:**
- Added `getMessagePairs()` function that groups consecutive turns into pairs
- Updated `applyPruning()` to hide/show entire pairs together
- Updated `updatePill()` to display pair counts
- Updated `getStats` to report pair counts

**How to Test:**
1. Open ChatGPT with a conversation
2. Count the visible exchanges (your prompt + ChatGPT's response)
3. The pill should show that exact count, not double

**Example:**
- You see 3 exchanges on screen (3 prompts from you + 3 responses from ChatGPT)
- Pill now shows: "3 visible / X total" ‚úì
- Previously showed: "6 visible / X total" ‚úó

### 2. Scroll-Up Auto-Load Fixed ‚úì

**Problem:** Scrolling to top didn't load more messages

**Fixed:** Now properly detects scroll position and loads more messages

**Changes:**
- Completely rewrote `setupScrollDetection()` 
- Now listens to both `window` scroll and `main` container scroll (ChatGPT uses a scrollable div)
- Added better debug logging to track scroll events
- Loads +5 pairs when scrolling within 300px of top
- Marks as auto-expanded so it resets when you send a new message
- Fixed `setupNewMessageDetection()` to detect new pairs (not individual turns)

**How to Test:**
1. Set "Messages to keep visible" to 3 in popup
2. Open a conversation with 10+ exchanges
3. Scroll down (should see only last 3 exchanges)
4. Slowly scroll up toward the top
5. Watch console (if debug enabled): should see scroll debug messages
6. When you reach near the top (within 300px), 5 more pairs should load automatically
7. Send a new message
8. Should automatically reset back to showing only 3 exchanges

**Debug Console Messages:**
```
[ChatGPT Speedup] Scroll: 150px, was: 250px, scrollingUp: true
[ChatGPT Speedup] At top with X hidden elements, auto-expanding...
[ChatGPT Speedup] Setting keepN to 8 (auto-expanded)
```

### 3. Search Enhanced with Navigation & Highlighting ‚úì

**Problem:** 
- Search didn't show match count
- No way to navigate between matches
- No visual highlighting

**Fixed:** Complete search overhaul with Ctrl+F-like functionality

**New Features:**
- ‚úì Shows "Match X of Y" count below search box
- ‚úì Navigation arrows: ‚óÄ Previous | üîç Search | ‚ñ∂ Next
- ‚úì Yellow highlighting for all matches (like Ctrl+F)
- ‚úì Orange highlighting for current match
- ‚úì Auto-scrolls to current match
- ‚úì Auto-shows hidden messages that contain matches
- ‚úì Press Escape to clear search
- ‚úì Clearing search input removes highlights

**Changes:**
- Added `searchState` object to track current query and matches
- Added `highlightInElement()` - walks DOM and wraps matches in `<mark>` tags
- Added `clearSearchHighlights()` - removes all highlights
- Updated `searchInMessages()` to support 'search', 'next', 'prev' actions
- Added message handlers: `searchNext`, `searchPrev`, `clearSearch`
- Updated popup.html with navigation buttons
- Updated popup.js with navigation logic and match display

**How to Test:**
1. Open popup on a ChatGPT conversation
2. Type a word you know exists (e.g., "the")
3. Click üîç Search
4. Should see: "Match 1 of X" and the word highlighted in yellow/orange
5. Click ‚ñ∂ Next to go to next match (highlights in orange)
6. Click ‚óÄ Previous to go back
7. Page should scroll to show the current match
8. Press Escape or clear the input to remove highlights

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Enter` in search box = Search
- `Escape` = Clear search and highlights
- Click ‚óÄ/‚ñ∂ buttons = Navigate matches

## No Git Push Yet

As requested, these changes are **NOT pushed to GitHub** yet. Test everything first, then when you're ready:

```bash
cd c:\Users\teoin\chatgpt-speedup
git add .
git commit -m "Fix all three issues: pairs counting, scroll auto-load, search enhancement"
git push origin main
```

---

## Rollback Instructions

If something goes wrong, restore from backup:

```bash
# Option 1: Restore from backup directory
copy backup-working-v1\*.* .

# Option 2: Restore from git tag v1.0.0
git checkout v1.0.0 -- content.js popup.js popup.html

# Then reload extension in Chrome
```

---

## Debug Mode

To see detailed logging:
1. Open popup
2. Check "Enable debug logs"
3. Click "Apply Settings"
4. Open ChatGPT page
5. Press F12 to open DevTools
6. Click Console tab
7. Look for `[ChatGPT Speedup]` messages

Debug logs will show:
- How many pairs were found
- Scroll position and direction
- When auto-expand triggers
- Search matches found
- Pruning operations

---

## Notes

- Scroll detection uses 200ms debounce to prevent excessive updates
- Search is case-insensitive
- Pair grouping assumes alternating user/assistant turns
- If conversation has odd number of turns, last turn is kept as single-element pair
- All three features work together seamlessly

**Status:** Ready for testing! üéâ

Please test all three features and let me know if anything needs adjustment before we commit.
