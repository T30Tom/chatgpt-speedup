# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is currently in early development; we aim to support the latest published release (tags like `v0.x.y`) and the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open public issues for security problems.

Instead, email teoinfotomasi@gmail.com with:
- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC)
- Any suggested mitigation/fix

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. After a fix is released, weâ€™ll credit reporters (if desired) in the changelog.

## Scope
- Source in this repository
- Packaged extension built from this repo

Out of scope: unrelated third-party services and unofficial forks.
